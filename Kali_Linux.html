        <h1>The Ultimate Kali Linux Manual and Course</h1>
        <p>
            Whether you're new to Information Security, or a seasoned security veteran, the Kali Linux Revealed Book and
            our online training exercises have something to teach you. The saying "You can't build a great building on a
            weak foundation" rings true in the information security field as well, and if you use (or want to learn to use)
            Kali Linux in a professional capacity, you should familiarize yourself as best as you can with the internals 
            of the penetration testing distribution. That is what this Kali Linux Revealed book is all about – turning you 
            into a Kali Linux professional user.
            <br>
            <br>
            Simply stated, learning how to master Kali gives you the freedom to create your own Kali Linux Recipes such
            as the Kali ISO of Doom, or the Evil Kali AP. After reading the Kali Linux Revealed book, you'll be able to
            build optimized and custom Kali Linux kernels, host them on your own deployment repositories, or create your
            own custom Kali Appliances – and there's so much more!
